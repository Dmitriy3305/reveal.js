Good day! For the assignment on presentation development, I have chosen the topic "Computer Architecture." Now, I will provide a brief overview of it.

Slide 2\
So, what is Computer Architecture?\
Computer architecture refers to the design and structure of a computer system, including its components, organization, and behavior. It encompasses the physical and logical structures, as well as the principles and methods employed in the design and operation of a computer system.

Slide 3\
What are the main components of computer architecture?

Slide 3.1\
Architecture of a computer consists of several components. Let's discuss each component in more detail.

Slide 4\
Input unit and associated peripherals
The input unit provides external data sources to the computer system. Therefore, it connects the external environment to the computer. It receives information from input devices, translates it to machine language, and then inserts it within the computer system.

Slide 5\
Output unit and associated peripherals\
The output unit delivers the computer process’s results to the user. A majority of the output data comprises music, graphics, or video. A computer architecture’s output devices encompass the display, printing unit, speakers, headphones, etc.

Slide 6\
Storage unit/memory\
The storage unit separated into primary storage and secondary storage.

Slide 6.1\
Primary storage unit\
This component of the computer architecture is also referred to as the main memory, as the CPU has direct access to it. Primary memory is utilized for storing information and instructions during program execution. Random access memory (RAM) and read-only memory (ROM) are the two kinds of memory:

RAM supplies the necessary information straight to the CPU. It is a temporary memory that stores data and instructions intermittently.
ROM is a memory type that contains pre-installed instructions, including firmware. This memory’s content is persistent and cannot be modified. ROM is utilized to boot the machine upon initial startup.

Slide 6.2\
Secondary or external storage is inaccessible directly to the CPU. Before the CPU uses secondary storage data, it must be transferred to the main storage. Secondary storage permanently retains vast amounts of data. Examples include hard disk drives, solid-state drives.

Slide 7\
Central processing unit (CPU)\
The central processing unit includes registers, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and control circuits, which interpret and execute assembly language instructions. The CPU interacts with all the other parts of the computer architecture to make sense of the data and deliver the necessary output.

The operating system governs the computer’s functionality just above firmware. It manages memory usage and regulates devices such as the keyboard, mouse, display, and disc drives. The OS also provides the user with an interface, allowing them to launch apps and access data on the drive.

Slide 9\
It is possible to set up and configure the above architectural components in numerous ways. This gives rise to the different types of computer architecture. The most notable ones include:
Instruction set architecture
Microarchitecture
Client-server architecture
Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) architecture
Multicore architecture

That's all I wanted to share about the topic of computer architecture. Thank you for your attention.
